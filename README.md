# Final-Project
This final project involves the combined usage Textblob and Flask to create a basic sentiment analysis web app. 

## Summary of Project
I focused my Midterm Package Research on Textblob, I still wanted to utilize that aspect. However, I knew that I needed something else to make things more interesting; the purpose of creating this project was so that I could become more familiar with using Flask in conjunction with Textblob. This semester, I have learned not only Python but have also learned the basics and fundamentals for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As a result, I thought it would be a good idea to utilize these developed skills and create a project around them.

## Information Sources utilized
Because this project involved many areas of unfamiliarity, I found myself doing a lot of research and reading/watching various tutorials in order to understand what I wanted to do. Here is a list of some important sites/pages I have come across (and have been able to write down) that have aided me throughout this learning process. For many of these websites, I utilized several resources; I could not have done this project without the help they provided:

## How to successfully run the program
[Creating a Virtual Environment for Flask](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask)
A virtual environment is necessary because we will be installing our packages that way.

## How to successfully install Textblob and Flask
Once you have properly set up your virtual environment, here's how to install the necessary packages:
#### Installing Textblob:
Run the following commands into your terminal:
- python -m pip install textblob
- python -m textblob.download_corpora
#### Installing Flask (and its necessary components):
- python -m pip install flask
- python -m pip install flask_bootstrap
